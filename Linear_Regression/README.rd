I was learning "Machine Learning" and followed this tutorial.

But the tutorial is back dated for me as many functions is renamed and working process is now a bit different. And also, as a new learner, it was important for me to understand all the stuffs properly but that tutorial was not enough. So I created this .py file with all the  instructions added as comment in file. My English is bit bad and might be possible that I did something wrong. So if something is wrong feel free to ask me or push request.

I used atom as IDE but you can use spyder too so on you will be able to see what is going on with variables.
